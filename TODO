Current TODO:

Make widgets active by default.
Remove un-needed code.
Add naval units.
Put a simple game turn in.
Make all window setups use yaml files.

This is list of TODO's (earliest first) that I have on record.

*DONE*	Sort out the module mess.
*DONE*	Each module must be self contained and ONLY define things. If it needs
		a callback to data then it should from a central point.
*DONE*	The gui functions need to be called from most things, so:
		Say in SPQR_WIDGET it needs lgui. Each widget must have a
		local pointer to lgui, and so on.
*DONE*	Click on hex also checks unit and displays it
*DONE*	Only allow map panning above the map itself
*DONE*	Make map co-ords checking perfect (lots of fussy debugging)
*DONE*	Make detection of hex clicking pixel perfect
*DONE*	Make the menus look better (more space, icons, shortcuts)
*DONE*	Add keyboard detection in events, and add some keyboard shortcuts for the menus
*DONE*	Allow click dragging on mini-map
*DONE*	Implement a game turn by:
*DONE*	showing date/game turn
*DONE*  flash unit to move 
*DONE*  allow one-hex movement 
*DONE*	go through each unit after the move 
*DONE*	show 'end turn' button at end of turn
*DONE*	Make the next button float around all the units
*DONE*	Make widgets non-active by default
