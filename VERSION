0.0.9:	Split code into modules
0.0.91:	Added ability to pan map with middle mouse button
0.0.92:	Back on the case, changed the way the modules were layed out
0.1		If you click on a hex, it now shows you the hex and any units on it
0.1.1   Added a parser for game scenarios
0.1.2	Displays city names on main map
0.1.3	Displays info buttons for hex, and responds to them
0.1.4	Added game year visual, and next button for unit turn
0.1.5	Finished city details window. Parser now grabs players as well
0.1.6	Loops around and displays all your units via the next button
0.1.7	Added keyboard handling routines
0.1.8	Hex detection vastly improved: key clicks started to be integrated
           with menu code and messagebox code (the latter complete)
0.1.9	Menus look like the real deal now (and have keyboard shortcuts)
0.2.0	Menus fully complete: button highlights now work
0.2.1	Units flash when they are highlighted (and clipped on screen sides)
0.2.2	Unit shows movement possibilities, and they render fine.
           Also the interface for selecting troops now works
0.2.3	The above statement is not technically true, but now all that fancy
           unit flashing/updating stuff is working fine
0.2.4	Hex detection is now pixel perfect. Unit move possibilities all fine
0.2.5	Program reads some command line options now. Also splash screen has
           added, and movement keys have been put in (and work, but no anim yet)
0.2.6	Added unit strength,quality and morale to parser
0.2.7	Unit movement works fine, animation and everything
0.2.8	The basic turn has been implemented! Granted, you can only move around
        	the units but it *is* starting to feel like a game now
0.2.9	Slowly adding a battle screen
        	It's a lot of work, although you can now start a battle and retreat(!)
        	You can now (16/03/06) wait a round and see what happens
0.2.91	Again back on the case after a break. Re-writing code to allow for
        	a maximum of 4 units on every hex. Completion of this is v0.3
0.2.92	4 units on every hex is coming along fast, move and battle code seems
        	ok, but selection is still an issue (and some minor gfx glitches)
0.2.93	Game handles 4 units per hex just fine. Minor gfx effects all work
            Some very minor bugs to shave off and 0.3 will be here!
0.3 	I think (!) all issues with 4 units per hex are solved
        	Working on adding some new gui features - checkbox (working)
        	and slider (starting to work)
0.3.1	Slider and checkbox fully working
0.3.2   Added music, and preferences screen for it :-)
0.3.3   ScrollArea widget now fully working
0.3.31	Started to add unit list box
0.3.32	Added individuals to scenario file, parser and dataset
0.3.33	Unit list box and city list box complete except for callbacks
0.3.34	Actually adding a pretty complex ItemList to handle all list displays
		Code for this version *does not run*!!
0.3.35  Unit list box is broken but runs
0.3.36	Made console work, with some simple commands
0.3.37	Begads! The fancy complex ItemList builds all the gfx's fine.It just
		needs the callbacks to be implemented
0.3.38	Because the ItemList was pretty complex, it has made me clean up a
		whole bunch of window code, so that's what I'm ploughing through now
		The end result is a smaller code base as the cruft gets taken out
0.3.39	Arrow graphics added to ItemList (it's getting there!)
0.3.391	SLOWLY the ItemList is coming together. The arrows work fine.
0.3.4	Everything for the itemlist works ok!! Quite a fancy widget,
		*definitly* the most complex one so far
0.3.41	Now I'm going slowly through all the annoying TODO bits, before
		starting the battle screens again.
0.3.42	Rewrote gui dirty rects code (was buggy): added double-click callback.
		Fixed horrible bug that erased welcome screen at start
0.3.43	Added MenuOption widget ready for battle screen
0.3.431	Excuse to flag new start after a month off: also fixed dirty rect bug
0.3.432	Removed 500 lines of code whilst tidying unit animation code :-)
0.3.433	Removed another 500 lines and started re-coding the battle stuff
0.3.5	Began the change to update the code and move to region - based code
0.3.51	The GUI code has been replaced with the updated code from another
		project of mine.
0.3.52	Replaced image map with region-based image map. Removed movement code.
0.3.53	Updated key code. Tided up spqr.py somewhat (still needs work).
0.3.54	Back to hex based code :-) But the hexes are the right way this time
0.3.55	Flash animations pixel perfect. Almost ready to add new code.
0.3.56	Movement keys and animations now also work just fine.
0.3.57	Added new map graphics; updated main scenario file.
0.3.58	Shuffled and cleaned up data code; started work on battles.
0.3.581	Added working battle screen.
0.3.59	Added new map: ripped out old code data structure.
		Start of proper code re-structure
0.3.592	General code structure much improved. Old data system taken out.
		Code is being moved much closer to PEP-8
0.3.6   Code is almost 100% at new code standard
        Regions added. Code structure much improved.
0.3.61	Units, cities and flashing are back in the game.
0.3.612	Region selection and movement highlights put into game.
0.3.615 Movement graphic effect seems to work fine, this means movement is 80% complete.
0.3.7	Movement of units and naval units is complete.

Notable milestones:

0.0.65	Looks like a gui, speeded up gfx a lot
0.0.8	Menus work, though they could look a bit better
0.0.9	Splitting code into modules: I learnt a lot about python
0.2.0	First technology demo (i.e. everything works, in it's own limited way)
			It actually feels like a game now, even if there is nothing to play
0.2.8	The movement phase has been implemented, you can almost feel the game now
0.3.3	GUI much improved, looks and feels very GNOME-like
0.3.52	Move to region-based game. GUI had many bugs removed: code looks better.
0.3.6	With new map and new region code, game looks a lot different.
