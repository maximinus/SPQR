How to draw the regions:

For each region, there are 3 images:

xxx.png
xxx_icon.png
xxx_mask.png

The plain png file is an alpha .png that shows the order of the region. This is used to display
the colour of the border. The outer pixel border must be 0% transparent, the next pixel line must
be 33% transparent and the third line must be 66% transparent. The only colour used must be
#000000, black.

The icon file is png format file of which the longest side must be 95 pixels. This shows the region
and it's border, and is used to display region details, and when we need a small picture of the
region.

The mask file is a block black image that must be 40% transparant black.
